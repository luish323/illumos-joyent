# The SmartOS test package is expressly intended *not* to be
# installable on other distributions, and should not be
# up-streamed to the illumos-gate. It redelivers isaexec,
# ctfconvert and ctfmerge, which violates IPS requirements
# that only a single package deliver a given file,
# unless IPS variants are used.
#
# This package is used as part of the generation of the
# test archive .tgz during the smartos-live build in
# order to ensure files not normally delivered by SmartOS
# will appear in /usr when the smartos-test script has
# configured the system for testing.
