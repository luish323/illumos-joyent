.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures share groups and the shares contained within them.
.Pp
A group name must conform to service management facility (SMF)
.Po
see
.Xr smf 7
.Pc
service-naming conventions, thus is limited to starting with an
alphabetic character, with the rest of the name consisting only of alphanumeric
characters plus
.Ql \(hy
(hyphen) and
.Ql \(ru
(underbar).
.Pp
Subcommands that result in a configuration change support a dry-run option.
When dry-run
.Pq Fl n
is specified, the syntax and validity of the command is
tested but the configuration is not actually updated.
.Pp
For all subcommands, the
.Fl h
option lists usage and help information.
.Pp
For subcommands with the verbose
.Pq Fl v
option, additional information will be provided.
For example, in conjunction with the
.Fl n
option, verbose mode will also indicate whether the current user has
sufficient permissions to accomplish the operation.
.Pp
There are two groups that are created automatically.
The
.Sy default
group always exists and covers legacy NFS shares only.
The
.Sy zfs
group will be created when ZFS shares are enabled.
.Pp
The options shown in the
.Sx SYNOPSIS
section are described in the context of each subcommand.
All subcommands except
.Cm list
and
.Cm show
require root privileges or that you assume the Primary Administrator role.
.Ss "Subcommands"
With no subcommand entered, a
.Nm
command with the
.Fl h
option displays a usage message for all subcommands.
.Pp
The following subcommands follow
.Nm
on a command line.
Commands take the form:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
% \fBsharemgr \fI<subcommand>\fR [\fIoptions\fR]\fR
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width "1"
.It Cm create \
    Oo Fl nvh Oc \
    Oo Fl P Ar proto Oo \
        Fl p Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value \
    Oc Oc \
    Ar group
.Pp
Create a new group with specified name.
.Pp
If
.Fl n
is specified, the command checks only the validity of the command
and that the group does not already exist.
.Pp
If no protocol is specified, all known protocols are enabled for the specified
group.
If a protocol is specified, only that protocol is enabled.
You can specify properties for a specified protocol.
.Pp
If
.Ar group
exists, use of
.Fl P
adds the specified protocol to that group.
.Pp
As an example of the
.Cm create
subcommand, the following command creates a new group with the name
.Ar mygroup .
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr create mygroup\fR
.Ed
.Pp
Because no protocol was specified in the preceding command, all defined
protocols will be enabled on the group.
.It Cm delete \
    Oo Fl nvh Oc \
    Oo Fl P Ar proto Oc \
    Oo Fl f Oc \
    Ar group
.Pp
Delete the specified group.
If the group is not empty, you can use the
.Fl f
option to force the deletion, which unshares and removes all shares from the
group before removing the group itself.
.Pp
If you specify a protocol, rather than deleting the whole group, this
subcommand deletes the protocol from the group.
.Pp
The
.Fl n
option can be used to test the syntax of the command.
.Pp
As an example, the following command removes the group
.Ar mygroup
from the configuration if it is empty.
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr delete mygroup\fR
.Ed
.Pp
The following command removes any existing shares prior to removing the group.
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr delete -f mygroup\fR
.Ed
.Pp
Note the use of the force
.Pq Fl f
option, above.
.It Cm list \
    Oo Fl vh Oc \
    Oo Fl P Ar proto Oc
.Pp
List the defined groups.
.Pp
If a protocol is specified, list only those groups that have the specified
protocol defined.
.Pp
If the verbose option is specified, the current state of the group and all
protocols enabled on the group are listed as well.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr list -v\fR
mygroup    enabled    nfs
rdonlygrp  disabled   nfs
.Ed
.It Cm show \
    Oo Fl pvxh Oc \
    Oo Fl P Ar proto Oc \
    Oo Ar group Ns ... Oc
.Pp
Shows the contents of the specified group(s).
.Pp
If the verbose option is specified, the resource name and description of each
share is displayed if they are defined.
Otherwise, only the share paths are
displayed.
Also, when temporary shares are listed, they are prefixed with an asterisk
.Pq Ql * .
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option is specified, all options defined for the protocols of
the group are displayed, in addition to the display without options.
If the
.Fl P
option is used, the output is limited to those groups that have the
specified protocol enabled.
If the
.Fl x
option is specified, output is in XML format and the
.Fl p
and
.Fl v
options are ignored, because all information is included in the XML.
.Pp
The following example illustrates the use of the
.Fl p
option.
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr show -p mygroup\fR
default nfs=()
    * /data/backup
mygroup nfs=(nosuid=true)
      /export/home/home0
      /export/home/home1
.Ed
.Pp
The following example illustrates the use of the
.Fl v
option.
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr show -v mygroup\fR
mygroup
    HOME0=/export/home/home0    "Home directory set 0"
    HOME1=/export/home/home1    "Home directory set 1"
.Ed
.Pp
ZFS managed shares are handled in a way similar to the way NFS shares are
handled.
These shares appear as subgroups within the parent group
.Sy zfs .
The subgroups are always prefixed with
.Sy zfs/
and use the ZFS dataset name for the rest of the name.
The mount point and any sub-mounts that inherit
sharing are shown as the shares of the subgroup.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr show -vp zfs\fR
zfs        nfs=()
    zfs/ztest
          /ztest
          /ztest/backups
.Ed
.It Cm set \
    Oo Fl nvh Oc \
    Fl P Ar proto \
    Oo Fl S Ar optionset Oc \
    Oo Fl p Ar property Ns = Ar value Oc Ns ... \
    Oo Fl s Ar sharepath Oc \
    Ar group
.Pp
Set protocol-specific properties on the specified group.
.Pp
The
.Fl P
option is required and must specify a valid protocol.
.Pp
Optionsets are protocol-specific sets of properties that can be negotiated by
the protocol client.
For NFS, optionsets are equivalent to security modes as defined in
.Xr nfssec 7 .
If
.Fl S Ar optionset
is specified, the properties are applied to the selected optionset.
Otherwise they are applied to the general optionset.
.Pp
Together,
.Fl P
and
.Fl S
select a specific view of the group's options on which to work.
.Pp
Property values are strings.
A specified property is set to a new value if the
property already exists or is added to the protocol if it does not already
exist.
.Pp
In the general case, at least one property must be set.
If
.Fl S
is specified, properties can be omitted and the specified optionset is enabled
for the protocol.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option allows setting properties on a per-share basis.
While this is supported, it should be limited to managing legacy shares and to
the occasional need for an override of a group-level property or placing an
additional property on one share within a group.
.Pp
An example of this subcommand:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr set -P nfs -p anon=1234 mygroup\fR
.Ed
.Pp
The preceding command adds the property
.Sy anon=1234
to the
.Sy nfs
view of group
.Ar mygroup .
If
.Ar mygroup
has existing shares, they will all be reshared with the new property value(s).
.It Cm unset \
    Oo Fl nvh Oc \
    Fl P Ar proto \
    Oo Fl S Ar optionset Oc \
    Oo Fl p Ar property Oc Ns ... \
    Oo Fl s Ar sharepath Oc \
    Ar group
.Pp
Unset the specified properties for the protocol or for the specified
.Ar optionset
of the protocol.
.Pp
In the general case, at least one property must be set.
If
.Fl S
is specified, properties can be omitted and the specified optionset is removed
from the protocol.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option allows removing a share-specific property.
.Pp
An example of this subcommand:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr unset -P nfs -p anon mygroup\fR
.Ed
.Pp
The preceding command removes the
.Ar anon=
property from the
.Sy nfs
view of group
.Ar mygroup .
If
.Ar mygroup
has existing shares, they will all be reshared with the new property value(s).
.It Cm add-share \
    Oo Fl nth Oc \
    Oo Fl r Ar resource-name Oc \
    Oo Fl d Ar \(dqdescription text\(dq Oc \
    Fl s Ar sharepath \
    Ar group
.Pp
Add a new share to the specified group.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option is mandatory and takes a full directory path.
.Pp
If either or both of
.Fl d
and
.Fl r
are specified, they specify values associated with the share.
.Fl d
provides a description string to document the share and
.Fl r
provides a protocol-independent resource name.
Resource names are not used by NFS at this time but can be specified.
These names currently follow the same naming rules as group names.
.Pp
The temporary option
.Pq Fl t
results in the share being shared but not
stored in the configuration repository.
This option is intended for shares that
should not survive a reboot or server restart, or for testing purposes.
Temporary shares are indicated in the
.Cm show
subcommand output with an asterisk
.Pq Ql *
preceding the share.
.Pp
If
.Ar sharepath
is a ZFS path and that path is added to the
.Ar zfs
group,
.Nm
creates a new ZFS subgroup; the new share is added to that subgroup.
Any ZFS sub-filesystems under the ZFS filesystem designated by
.Ar sharepath
will inherit the shared status of
.Ar sharepath .
.Pp
The effect of the
.Cm add-share
subcommand on a ZFS dataset is determined by the values of the
.Sy sharesmb
and
.Sy sharenfs
properties of that dataset.
.Pp
See
.Xr zfs 8
for a description of the
.Sy sharesmb
and
.Sy sharenfs
properties.
.Pp
The following are examples of the
.Cm add-share
subcommand.
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr add-share -s /export/home/home0 -d "home \e
directory set 0" -r HOME0 mygroup\fR

# \fBsharemgr add-share -s /export/home/home1 -d "home \e
directory set 1" -r HOME1 mygroup\fR
.Ed
.Pp
The preceding commands add
.Pa /export/home/home0
and
.Pa /export/home/home1
to the group
.Ar mygroup .
A descriptive comment and a resource name are included.
.It Cm move-share \
    Oo Fl nvh Oc \
    Fl s Ar sharepath \
    Ar destination-group
.Pp
Move the specified share from the group it is currently in to the specified
destination group.
The
.Cm move-share
subcommand does not create a group.
A specified group must exist for the command to succeed.
.Pp
The following is an example of this subcommand.
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr move-share -s /export/home/home1 newgroup\fR
.Ed
.Pp
Assuming
.Pa /export/home/home1
is in the group
.Ar mygroup ,
the preceding command moves
.Pa /export/home/home1
to the group
.Ar newgroup
and unshares and then reshares the directory with the properties associated with
.Ar newgroup .
.It Cm remove-share \
    Oo Fl fnvh Oc \
    Fl s Ar sharepath \
    Ar group
.Pp
Remove the specified share from the specified group.
The force
.Pq Fl f
option forces the share to be removed even if it is busy.
.Pp
You must specify the full path for
.Ar sharepath .
For group, use the subgroup as displayed in the output of the
.Nm Cm show
command.
Note that if
there are subshares that were created by inheritance, these will be removed,
along with the parent shares.
.It Cm set-share \
    Oo Fl nvh Oc \
    Oo Fl r resource Oc \
    Oo Fl d Ar \(dqdescription text\(dq Oc \
    Fl s Ar sharepath \
    Ar group
.Pp
Set or change the specified share's description and resource values.
One use of
.Cm set-share
is to rename a resource.
The syntax for this use of the subcommand is:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr set-share -r \fIcurrent_name\fR=\fInew_name\fR -s \fIsharepath\fR \fIgroup\fR\fR
.Ed
.It Cm enable \
    Oo Fl nvh Oc \
    Oo Ar group Ns ... | Fl a Oc
.Pp
Enable the specified group(s), or
.Po
with
.Fl a
.Pc
all groups, and start sharing the contained shares.
This state persists across reboots.
.Pp
An enabled group will be shared whenever the corresponding SMF service instance
is enabled.
.Nm
will start the SMF service instance if it is not currently online.
.It Cm disable \
    Oo Fl nvh Oc \
    Oo Ar group Ns ... | Fl a Oc
.Pp
Disable the specified group(s), or
.Po
with
.Fl a
.Pc
all groups, and unshare the shares that they contain.
This state persists across reboots.
.Pp
A disabled group will not be shared even if the corresponding SMF service
instance is online.
This feature is useful when you do not want a group of
shares to be started at boot time.
.It Cm start \
    Oo Fl vh Oc \
    Oo Fl P Ar proto Oc \
    Oo Ar group Ns ... | Fl a Oc
.Pp
Start the specified group, or
.Po
with
.Fl a
.Pc
all groups.
The
.Cm start
subcommand is similar to
.Cm enable
in that all shares are started, but
.Cm start
works only on groups that are enabled.
.Cm start
is used by the SMF to start sharing at system boot.
.Pp
A group will not start sharing if it is in the
.Nm sharemgr Em disabled
state.
However, the corresponding SMF service instance will be started.
.Pp
Note that the
.Cm start
subcommand is similar to the
.Xr shareall 8
command in that it starts up only the configured shares.
That is, the enabled
shares will start being shared, but the configuration state is left the same.
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr start -a\fR
.Ed
.Pp
\&...is equivalent to:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBshareall\fR
.Ed
.It Cm stop \
    Oo Fl vh Oc \
    Oo Fl P Ar proto Oc \
    Oo Ar group Ns ... | Fl a Oc
.Pp
Stop the specified group, or
.Po
with
.Fl a
.Pc
all groups.
The
.Cm stop
subcommand is similar to
.Cm disable
in that all shares are no longer shared,
but it works only on groups that are enabled.
.Cm stop
is used by the SMF to stop sharing at system shutdown.
.Pp
Note that the
.Cm stop
subcommand is similar to the
.Xr unshareall 8
command in that all active shares are unshared, but the configuration is left
the same.
That is, the shares are stopped but the service instances are left enabled.
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBsharemgr stop -a\fR
.Ed
.Pp
\&...is equivalent to:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBunshareall\fR
.Ed
.It Cm share \
    Oo Fl F Ar fstype Oc \
    Oo Fl p Oc \
    Oo Fl o Ar optionlist Oc \
    Oo Fl d Ar descriptoion Oc \
    Oo Ar pathname Oo Ar resoucename Oc Oc
.Pp
Shares the specified path in the
.Ar default
share group.
This subcommand implements the
.Xr share 8
functionality.
Shares that are shared in this manner will be transient shares.
Use of the
.Fl p
option causes the shares to be persistent.
.It Cm unshare \
    Oo Fl F Ar fstype Oc \
    Oo Fl p Oc \
    Oo Fl o Ar optionlist Oc \
    Ar sharepath
.Pp
Unshares the specified share.
This subcommand implements the
.Xr unshare 8
functionality.
By default, the
.Cm unshare
is temporary.
The
.Fl p
option
is provided to remove the share from the configuration in a way that persists
across reboots.
.El
.Ss "Supported Properties"
Properties are protocol-specific.
Currently, only the NFS and SMB protocols are supported.
Properties have the following characteristics:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
Values of type
.Sy boolean
take either
.Sy true
or
.Sy false .
.It
Values of type
.Sy value
take a numeric value.
.It
Values of type
.Sy file
take a file name and not a file path.
.It
Values of type
.Sy access-list
are described in detail following the descriptions of the NFS properties.
.El
.Pp
The general properties supported for NFS are:
.Bl -tag -width 1
.It Cm abe Ns = Ns Ar boolean
.Pp
Set the access-based enumeration (ABE) policy for a share.
When set to
.Ql true ,
ABE filtering is enabled on this share and directory entries to
which the requesting user has no access will be omitted from directory listings
returned to the client.
When set to
.Ql false
or not defined, ABE filtering will not be performed on this share.
This property is not defined by default.
.Bl -tag -width disabled
.It false
Disable ABE for this share.
.It true
Enable ABE for this share.
.El
.It Cm aclok Ns = Ns Ar boolean
.Pp
Allows the NFS server to do access control for NFS Version 2 clients (running
SunOS 2.4 or earlier).
When
.Cm aclok
is set on the server, maximum access is given to all clients.
For example, with
.Cm aclok
set, if anyone has read permissions, then everyone does.
If
.Cm aclok
is not set, minimum access is given to all clients.
.It Cm ad-container
.Pp
Specifies the AD container in which to publish shares.
.Pp
The AD container is specified as a comma-separated list of attribute name-value
pairs using the LDAP distinguished name (DN) or relative distinguished name
(RDN) format.
The DN or RDN must be specified in LDAP format using the
.Ar cn= ,
.Ar ou= ,
and
.Ar dc=
prefixes:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
.Cm cn
represents the common name
.It
.Cm ou
represents the organizational unit
.It
.Cm dc
represents the domain component
.El
.Pp
.Cm cn= ,
.Cm ou= ,
and
.Cm dc=
are attribute types.
The attribute type used
to describe an object's RDN is called the naming attribute, which, for ADS,
includes the following object classes:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
.Cm cn
for the
.Sy user
object class
.It
.Cm ou
for the organizational unit
.Pq Cm OU
object class
.It
.Cm dc
for the
.Cm domainDns
object class
.El
.It Cm anon Ns = Ns Ar uid
.Pp
Set
.Ar uid
to be the effective user ID of unknown users.
By default, unknown users are given the effective user ID
.Dv UID_NOBODY .
If uid is set to
.Sy -1 ,
access is denied.
.It Cm catia Ns = Ns Ar boolean
.Pp
CATIA V4 uses characters in file names that are considered to be invalid by
Windows.
CATIA V5 is available on Windows.
A CATIA V4 file could be
inaccessible to Windows clients if the file name contains any of the characters
that are considered illegal in Windows.
By default, CATIA character substitution is not performed.
If the
.Cm catia
property is set to true, the following character
substitution is applied to file names.
.Bd -literal -offset 2n

.Ed
.It Cm cksum Ns = Ns Ar cksumlist
.Pp
Set the share to attempt to use end-to-end checksums.
The value
.Ar cksumlist
specifies the checksum algorithms that should be used.
.It Cm csc Ns = Ns Ar value
.Pp
Set the client-side caching policy for a share.
Client-side caching is a client
feature and offline files are managed entirely by the clients.
.Pp
The following are valid values for the
.Cm csc
property:
.Bl -tag -width disabled -offset indent
.It Sy manual
Clients are permitted to cache files from the specified
share for offline use as requested by users.
However, automatic file-by-file reintegration is not permitted.
.Sy manual
is the default value.
.It Sy auto
Clients are permitted to automatically cache files from the
specified share for offline use and file-by-file reintegration is permitted.
.It Sy vdo
Clients are permitted to automatically cache files from the
specified share for offline use, file-by-file reintegration is permitted, and
clients are permitted to work from their local cache even while offline.
.It Sy disabled
Client-side caching is not permitted for this share.
.El
.It Cm guestok Ns = Ns Ar boolean
.Pp
Set the guest access policy for the share.
When set to
.Sy true
guest access is allowed on this share.
When set to
.Sy false
or not defined guest access is not allowed on this share.
This property is not defined by default.
.Pp
An
.Xr idmap 8
name-based rule can be used to map
.Sy guest
to any local username, such as
.Sy guest
or
.Sy nobody .
If the local account has a password in
.Pa /var/smb/smbpasswd
the guest connection will be authenticated against that password.
Any connection made using an account that maps to the
local guest account will be treated as a guest connection.
.Pp
Example name-based rule:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBidmap add winname:Guest unixuser:guest\fR
.Ed
.It Cm index Ns = Ns Ar file
.Pp
Load
.Ar file
rather than a listing of the directory containing this file
when the directory is referenced by an NFS URL.
.It Cm log Ns = Ns Ar tag
.Pp
Enables NFS server logging for the specified system.
The optional tag determines the location of the related log files.
The tag is defined in
.Pa /etc/nfs/nfslog.conf .
If no tag is specified, the default values
associated with the global tag in
.Pa /etc/nfs/nfslog.conf
is used.
Support of
NFS server logging is available only for NFS Version 2 and Version 3 requests.
.It Cm nosub Ns = Ns Ar boolean
.Pp
Prevents clients from mounting subdirectories of shared directories.
For example, if
.Pa /export
is shared with the
.Cm nosub
option on server
.Ql wool
then an NFS client cannot do:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
# \fBmount -F nfs wool:/export/home/mnt\fR
.Ed
.Pp
NFS Version 4 does not use the MOUNT protocol.
The
.Cm nosub
option applies only to NFS Version 2 and Version 3 requests.
.It Cm nosuid Ns = Ns Ar boolean
.Pp
By default, clients are allowed to create files on a shared file system with
the
.Sy setuid
or
.Sy setgid
mode enabled.
Specifying
.Sy nosuid
causes the server file system to silently ignore any attempt to enable the
.Sy setuid
or
.Sy setgid
mode bits.
.It Cm public Ns = Ns Ar boolean
.Pp
Moves the location of the public file handle from root
.Pq /
to the exported directory for WebNFS-enabled browsers and clients.
This option does not enable WebNFS service; WebNFS is always on.
Only one file system per server can have the
.Sy public
property.
You can apply the
.Sy public
property only to a share and not to a group.
.El
.Pp
NFS also supports negotiated optionsets for supported security modes.
The security modes are documented in
.Xr nfssec 7 .
The properties supported for these optionsets are:
.Bl -tag -width 1
.It Cm charset Ns = Ns Ar access-list
.Pp
Where
.Cm charset
is one of:
.Sy euc-cn ,
.Sy euc-jp ,
.Sy euc-jpms ,
.Sy euc-kr ,
.Sy euc-tw ,
.Sy iso8859-1 ,
.Sy iso8859-2 ,
.Sy iso8859-5 ,
.Sy iso8859-6 ,
.Sy iso8859-7 ,
.Sy iso8859-8 ,
.Sy iso8859-9 ,
.Sy iso8859-13 ,
.Sy iso8859-15 ,
.Sy koi8-r .
.Pp
Clients that match the
.Ar access-list
for one of these properties will be
assumed to be using that character set and file and path names will be
converted to UTF-8 for the server.
.It Cm ro Ns = Ns Ar access-list
.Pp
Sharing is read-only to the clients listed in
.Ar access-list ;
overrides the
.Cm rw
suboption for the clients specified.
See the description of
.Ar access-list
below.
.It Cm rw Ns = Ns Ar access-list
.Pp
Sharing is read-write to the clients listed in
.Ar access-list ;
overrides the
.Cm ro
suboption for the clients specified.
See the description of
.Ar access-list
below.
.It Cm none Ns = Ns Ar access-list
.Pp
Access is not allowed to any client that matches the access list.
The exception
is when the access list is an asterisk
.Pq Ql * ,
in which case
.Cm ro
or
.Cm rw
can override
.Cm none .
.It Cm root Ns = Ns Ar access-list
.Pp
Only root users from the hosts specified in
.Ar access-list
have root access.
See details on
.Ar access-list
below.
By default, no host has root access, so
root users are mapped to an anonymous user ID (see the
.Cm anon Ns = Ns Ar uid
option described above).
Netgroups can be used if the file system shared is using UNIX
authentication
.Pq Dv AUTH_SYS .
.It Cm root_mapping Ns = Ns Ar uid
.Pp
For a client that is allowed root access, map the root UID to the specified
user id.
.It Cm window Ns = Ns Ar value
.Pp
When sharing with
.Cm sec Ns = Ns Sy dh
.Po
see
.Xr nfssec 7
.Pc ,
set the maximum lifetime (in seconds) of the RPC request's credential
(in the authentication header) that the NFS server allows.
If a credential arrives with a lifetime larger than
what is allowed, the NFS server rejects the request.
The default value is 30000 seconds (8.3 hours).
This property is ignored for security modes other than
.Sy dh .
.El
.Pp
The general properties supported for SMB are:
.Bl -tag -width 1
.It Cm encrypt Ns = Ns Ar string
.Pp
Controls SMB3 per-share encryption.
This is similar to the global smbd/encrypt option.
For requests on a particular share, the server's behavior is controlled
by the stricter of this option and smbd/encrypt.
.Pp
When set to
.Sy disabled ,
the server will not ask clients to encrypt requests.
When set to
.Sy enabled ,
the server will ask clients to encrypt requests,
but will not require that they do so.
Any message than can be encrypted will be encrypted.
When set to
.Sy required ,
the server will deny access to or disconnect
any client that does not support encryption or fails to encrypt requests
that they should.
.Pp
In other words, the
.Sy enabled
behavior is that any message that CAN
be encrypted SHOULD be encrypted, while the
.Sy required
behavior is that any message that CAN be encrypted MUST be encrypted.
.Pp
This property is not defined by default.
.It Cm ro Ns = Ns Ar access-list
.Pp
Sharing is read-only to the clients listed in
.Ar access-list ;
overrides the
.Cm rw
suboption for the clients specified.
See the description of
.Ar access-list
below.
.It Cm rw Ns = Ns Ar access-list
.Pp
Sharing is read-write to the clients listed in
.Ar access-list ;
overrides the
.Cm ro
suboption for the clients specified.
See the description of
.Ar access-list
below.
.It Cm none Ns = Ns access-list
.Pp
Access is not allowed to any client that matches the access list.
The exception is when the access list is an asterisk
.Pq Ql * ,
in which case
.Cm ro
or
.Cm rw
can override
.Cm none .
.El
.Ss "Access List Argument"
The
.Ar access-list
argument is either the string
.Ql *
to represent all hosts or a colon-separated list whose components can be any
number of the following:
.Bl -tag -width 1
.It Ar hostname
.Pp
The name of a host.
With a server configured for DNS or LDAP naming in the
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5
.Ql hosts
entry, a hostname must be represented as a fully qualified DNS or LDAP name.
.It Ar netgroup
.Pp
A
.Ar netgroup
contains a number of hostnames.
With a server configured for DNS or LDAP naming in the
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5
.Ql hosts
entry, any
hostname in a netgroup must be represented as a fully qualified DNS or LDAP
name.
.It Ar domainname . Ns Ar suffix
.Pp
To use domain membership the server must use DNS or LDAP, rather than, for
example, NIS, to resolve hostnames to IP addresses.
That is, the
.Sy hosts
entry in the
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5
must specify
.Ql dns
or
.Ql ldap
ahead of
.Ql nis ,
because only DNS and LDAP return the full domain name of the host.
Other name services, such as NIS,
cannot be used to resolve hostnames on the server because, when mapping
an IP address to a hostname, they do not return domain information.
For example, for the IP address 172.16.45.9:
.Bl -tag -width "DNS OR LDAP"
.It Sy NIS
Returns:
.Sy myhost
.It Sy DNS or LDAP
Returns:
.Sy myhost.mydomain.example.com
.El
.Pp
The domain name suffix is distinguished from hostnames and netgroups by a
prefixed dot.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
rw=.mydomain.example.com
.Ed
.Pp
A single dot can be used to match a hostname with no suffix.
For example, the
specification:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
rw=.
.Ed
.Pp
\&...matches
.Ql mydomain
but not
.Ql mydomain.example.com .
This feature can be used to match hosts resolved through NIS rather than DNS and
LDAP.
.It Ar network
.Pp
The network or subnet component is preceded by an at-sign
.Pq Ql @ .
It can be either a name or a dotted address.
If a name, it is converted to a dotted address by
.Xr getnetbyname 3SOCKET .
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
=@mynet
.Ed
.Pp
\&...is equivalent to:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
=@172.16 or =@172.16.0.0
.Ed
.Pp
The network prefix assumes an octet-aligned netmask determined from the zeroth
octet in the low-order part of the address up to and including the high-order
octet, if you want to specify a single IP address.
In the case where network
prefixes are not byte-aligned, the syntax allows a mask length to be specified
explicitly following a slash
.Pq Ql /
delimiter.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
=@theothernet/17 or =@172.16.132/22
.Ed
.Pp
\&...where the mask is the number of leftmost contiguous significant bits in
the corresponding IP address.
.El
.Pp
A prefixed minus sign
.Pq Ql -
denies access to a component of
.Ar access-list .
The list is searched sequentially until a match is found
that either grants or denies access, or until the end of the list is reached.
For example, if host
.Ql terra
is in the netgroup
.Ql engineering ,
then:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
rw=-terra:engineering
.Ed
.Pp
\&...denies access to
.Ql terra ,
but:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
rw=engineering:-terra
.Ed
.Pp
\&...grants access to
.Ql terra .
